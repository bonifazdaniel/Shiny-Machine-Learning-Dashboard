# Polynomial Regression Module (`polynomial_regression_module.R`)

## Overview
The `polynomial_regression_module.R` extends regression analysis by providing tools to perform polynomial regression within the Shiny Machine Learning Dashboard. This module allows users to fit and visualize polynomial models of varying degrees to better capture complex relationships.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Variable Selection**: Choose X and Y variables from the dataset.
- **Adjustable Polynomial Degree**: Select the degree of the polynomial for the regression model.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Display polynomial regression curves overlaid on scatter plots of the data.
- **Performance Metrics**: Compute R², MSE, and MAE for the selected polynomial model.

## What You Can Achieve
Using the `polynomial_regression_module.R`, you can:
1. Fit polynomial regression models to explore non-linear relationships in your data.
2. Compare models of varying polynomial degrees to find the best fit.
3. Visualize polynomial regression curves for enhanced data understanding.

## Visualizations and Results
- **Polynomial Regression Plot**: Displays the data points along with the fitted polynomial regression curve.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides R², MSE, and MAE for the selected model.
