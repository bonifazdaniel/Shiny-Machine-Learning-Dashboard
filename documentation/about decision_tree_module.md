# Decision Tree Module (`decision_tree_module.R`)

## Overview
The `decision_tree_module.R` provides tools to build and visualize decision trees within the Shiny Machine Learning Dashboard. This module supports both **regression** and **classification** tasks, allowing users to explore decision-making rules in their datasets.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Variable Selection**: Choose target (Y) and predictor (X) variables.
- **Tree Types**: Build either regression or classification trees.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Display the decision tree structure and analyze variable importance.
- **Customizable Tree**: Adjust input variables to refine the model interactively.

## What You Can Achieve
Using the `decision_tree_module.R`, you can:
1. Build decision trees to understand how input variables influence the target variable.
2. Visualize the tree structure for clear decision-making paths.
3. Analyze variable importance to identify key predictors.

## Visualizations and Results
- **Decision Tree Diagram**: Displays the structure of the decision tree.
- **Variable Importance Plot**: Highlights the contribution of each variable in the model.

---

**Note**: Ensure the dataset includes both numeric and/or categorical variables for building decision trees. Target variables should be numeric for regression trees or factors for classification trees.
