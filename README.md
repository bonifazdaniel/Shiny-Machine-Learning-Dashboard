# Shiny-Machine-Learning-Dashboard
Shiny Machine Learning Dashboard
This project implements an interactive dashboard using R and Shiny, created by Daniel Bonifaz-Calvo.

Features:
-Linear Regression: For predicting numeric outcomes.
-Polynomial Regression: For analyzing non-linear relationships.
-K-Means Clustering: For data segmentation.
-Decision Tree: For rule-based classification and regression.
-ARIMA: For time series forecasting.

Additional Visualizations: Including histograms, residual plots, and correlation matrices.

Performance Metrics: RÂ², MSE, and MAE for regression models.

Dynamic Filtering: To explore subsets of the data interactively.

Export Options: Save results in CSV or PDF format.

Usage:
-Install the necessary dependencies in R:
Install.packages(c("shiny", "DT", "ggplot2", "forecast", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "gridExtra"))
-Run the main application file: shiny::runApp("app/app.R")
-Interact with the data and results on the dashboard.
